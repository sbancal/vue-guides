## Understanding VueJS, Syntax, and the Essentials | Section Overview

In this section, you got familiar with the syntax of Vue. You went over some key concepts to understand how Vue works. With this foundational knowledge, you can now move on to start exploring application development with Vue!

This section overview doubles as a coding break for you though. Remember, approach this course at the pace you’re comfortable with. So grab a cup of coffee, tea, or hot chocolate! Whatever you need to keep your mind geared and ready to continue learning.

With that, let’s overview some of the important topics that appeared in this section:

* A Vue instance accepts an options object that allows us to manipulate html and add reactivity through various Vue features.

* A Vue directive follows the v- pattern and allows us to add dynamic attributes to elements of the html.

* The v-if directive accomplishes conditional rendering.

* The v-for directive creates dynamic lists.

* V-on allows interactivity by binding instance methods to the click handler of elements.

* Components in Vue encapsulate HTML with Vue interactivity and create reusable code.

* V-models map data to pieces of HTML to allow two-way data binding,

* Computed properties use complex logic to return modified pieces of data.

* Lifecycle hooks like created, mounted, and updated allow vue instances to run specific code throughout its lifespan.
